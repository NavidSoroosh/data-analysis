# Data analysis with MATLAB

This project implements and compares **generative** and **discriminative** classifiers using MATLAB. It's designed for educational and research purposes, exploring how different classification paradigms behave on various datasets.

- **Generative Classifiers**:
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

- **Discriminative Classifiers**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Perceptron Algorithm
